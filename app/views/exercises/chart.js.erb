// The `ajax` block below should get called when you make the request for generating the chart.

$.ajax({
  dataType: "json",
  type: "get",
  url: "/exercises/chart" + activity
}).done(graph_activity);

// "/exercises/chart/some_activity" routes to the exercises#chart controller action. It returns JSON.

// When the AJAX request is done, you will have that JSON response, which is passed to the 'done' callback function:

graph_activity = function(exercise_data){
  // Write the code here to generate the chart with Morris JS.
